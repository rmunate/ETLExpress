# Installation

## Requirements

For this solution to work correctly, you must have at least PHP 8.0 installed, as the package includes typed data in its core.

You must have Laravel Framework version 8 or higher.

Finally, our package relies on the native PHP `INTL` extension, check in your `php.ini` that you have it.

## Install

### Composer

To install the dependency via Composer, execute the following command:

``` bash
composer require rmunate/spell-number
```

The package will automatically register itself.

**That's all!**
